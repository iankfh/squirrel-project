# squirrel-project
This is the repository for the IEOR E4501 final project.

Description:

This project implements a website that shares data on squirrel sightings in Central Park.  The map/ page plots the location of the sightings on an OpenStreet map.  The sightings/ page lists of all the sightings tracked to date. The sightings/stats/ page shares some summary statistics. The sightings/add/ page allows you to input a new squirrel sighting. From the sightings/ page, by clicking "edit", you can access the detail page for each sighting and edit the information as needed.
